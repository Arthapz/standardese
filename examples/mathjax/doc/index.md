This project uses [MathJax](https://mathjax.org) to display $$\LaTeX$$ in its HTML output.

This file was generated from a static index.md file. The documentation for
[mathjax.hpp](./generated/markdown/doc_mathjax.md) was generated with
[standardese](https://github.com/standardese/standardese).

MathJax is loaded through a script tag in the `_include/footer.html` file that
is shared by all output that Jekyll generates.
